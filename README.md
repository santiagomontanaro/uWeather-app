# Welcome to uWeather App

This is a simple weather app that uses the OpenWeatherMap API to get the weather data. Also you can search for a city and add it to a list of cities that you want to see the weather.
You can also delete the cities from the list or click on the city to see the weather details. That redirect you to a new screen with the weather details and a nice background from the city.

## This project was made with:

- ReactJs
- React Router Dom (for the navigation)
- React Hooks

- [Pexels API] (https://www.pexels.com/api/) (for the background videos)
